## ChromiumOS

*   __board__: The name of the system you're building ChromiumOS for; see the
    [official ChromeOS device list](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices)
    for examples.
*   __build_target__: The new, preferred term for board.
*   __model__: Model generally refers to a ChromeOS device that is unique in
    the market. A model typically maintains the major hardware components of
    its parent board but may vary in minor elements of one or more of: physical
    design, OEM, or ODM.
*   __platform__: Platform may refer to any of the following: (1) a System on a
    Chip family, (2) a ChromeOS device, (3) the ChromeOS Platform Team.
*   __image__: A set of binary files created from the ChromeOS source code
    that contains everything needed to run ChromeOS on a device. There are
    numerous types of images, including unsigned build images (which can be
    deployed on a device for development and testing), signed build images
    (which support secure verified boot), and Final Shipping Images (FSI, which
    are deployed to a device during manufacturing).
*   __manifest__: Refers to ChromeOS's [Repo](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/tools/repo-tool/)
    manifest. A Repo manifest is an XML file or set of XML files that describes
    the Git repositories and refs that make up a ChromeOS image. See
    [Local & Remote Source Tree Layouts](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/development/source-layout/).
*   __buildspec__: A manifest where every git repository is pinned to a specific
    git revision, used to represent a specific build (version) of ChromeOS.
*   __snapshot__: A manifest where every git repository is pinned to a specific
    git revision, created regularly by annealing at regular time intervals from
    tip-of-tree.
*   __firmware__: Software that provides low-level control of a device's
    hardware. Perhaps the two most important pieces of firmware on a Chromebook
    are for the Application Processor (AP) and Embedded Controller (EC), but
    there are many others, for example in WiFi adapters, fingerprint sensors,
    touchscreen controllers, and many more. External peripherals such as USB-C
    docks and Bluetooth accessories may also have updatable firmware.
*   __devserver__: System for updating packages on a ChromiumOS device
    without having to use a USB stick or doing a full reimage. See the
    [Dev Server page](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/chromite/+/HEAD/docs/devserver.md).
*   __powerwash__: Wiping of the stateful partition (system & all users) to
    get a device back into a pristine state. The TPM is not cleared, and Lockbox
    is kept intact (thus it is not the same as a factory reset). See the
    [Powerwash design doc](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/powerwash).


## ChromiumOS Build

Terms related to building ChromiumOS.

*   __buildroot__: The buildroot refers to the
    source root of the checkout that is being built. This term is rarely used,
    but in certain contexts is necessary to distinguish between the current
    process' source root, and that of the checkout that is actually being built.
*   __chroot__: A chroot jail is used to isolate the CrOS SDK. The term chroot
    refers to an instance of the SDK for our contexts.
*   __sysroot__: The term sysroot comes from portage. With respect to ChromeOS,
    a sysroot is where a build target (board) is built. When completed, sysroots
    essentially have the filesystem you will find on a device's root partitions.
    By default, they can be found in /build/ inside your chroot.
*   __uprev__: The process of updating the revision (or version) of a package.
    The purpose is to produce a new ebuild with a higher overall version number
    to allow the build system to pick up changes made to the package. Packages
    that inherit from `cros-workon` can be automatically uprevved by the
    builders. There is a generic process that covers most packages, and some
    specialized processes for a few specific packages (e.g. chrome, android).
*   __overlay__: Directory on disk with Portage metadata, forming a collection
    of packages and profiles. Portage uses the set of overlays visible for
    a given board and composes it all into a build.
    See [Gentoo Docs for overlays](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ebuild_repository).
    Examples:
    [`chromiumos`](https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/HEAD:src/third_party/chromiumos-overlay/),
    [`chipset-stnyridge`](http://cs/chromeos_public/src/overlays/chipset-stnyridge/) (Google-internal),
    [`amd64-generic`](https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/HEAD:src/overlays/overlay-amd64-generic/).
*   __private overlay__: Per-device specialized packages on top of an
    existing overlay. Could contain ebuild/config for proprietary targets
    such as firmware, media drivers, etc. Example:
    [`grunt-private`](http://cs/chromeos_internal/src/private-overlays/overlay-grunt-private/)
    (Google-internal).
*   __profile__: One or more files where the majority of board customization
    happens -- `USE` customizations across all packages in `make.defaults`,
    or `USE` and `KEYWORDS` on a per-package basis (via the `package.use`
    and `package.keywords` files, respectively).
    See [Gentoo Docs for profiles](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Profile_(Portage)).
    Example: [amd64-generic:base](https://source.chromium.org/chromiumos/chromiumos/codesearch/+/HEAD:src/overlays/overlay-amd64-generic/profiles/base/)
*   __stepping stone__: An intermediate OS version that a device must update to
    before it can upgrade to newer versions.  e.g. CrOS R50 must update to R72
    before it can upgrade to R100.
*   __variant__:  A CrOS-specific deprecated mechanism, still in-use by some
    boards, to share settings across similar boards.
*   __`USE` flag__: A Portage mechanism to enable/disable features for packages,
    e.g. support for X11.
*   __Keyword flag__: Used in `cros_workon` for uprevving packages.
