## What's the difference between ChromiumOS and Google ChromeOS?

Google ChromeOS is to ChromiumOS what Google Chrome browser is to Chromium.

*   **ChromiumOS** is the open source project, used primarily by
            developers, with code that is available for anyone to checkout,
            modify, and build.
*   **Google ChromeOS** is the Google product that OEMs ship on
            Chromebooks for general consumer use.

Some specific differences:

*   The two projects fundamentally share the same code base, but Google
            ChromeOS has some additional firmware features, including verified
            boot and easy recovery, which require corresponding hardware changes
            and thus also don't work out of the box in ChromiumOS builds.
*   Google ChromeOS runs on specially optimized hardware in order to
            get enhanced performance and security.
*   ChromiumOS does not auto-update by default (so that changes you may
            have made to the code are not blown away), whereas Google ChromeOS
            seamlessly auto-updates so that users have the latest and greatest
            features and fixes.
*   Google ChromeOS is supported by Google and its partners; Chromium
            OS is supported by the open source community.
*   Google ChromeOS includes some binary packages which are not allowed
            to be included in the ChromiumOS project. A non-exhaustive list:
    *   Adobe Flash
    *   Widevine CDM plugin (to support [HTML5
                EME](https://w3c.github.io/encrypted-media/))
    *   3G Cellular support (but work is on going to address this)
    *   DisplayLink Manager for video over USB (some systems)
    *   Android (ARC++) container for running Android apps
*   Some components are available in both, but as closed source
            binary-only blobs. A non-exhaustive list:
    *   Graphics Libraries (e.g. OpenGL) on ARM platforms
*   Google Chrome ships with its own set of [API
            keys](http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys) while
            Chromium does not include any
    *   Users are expected to set up their own
*   Google ChromeOS has a [green/yellow/red
            logo](https://www.google.com/intl/en/images/logos/chrome_logo.gif)
            while ChromiumOS has a [blue/bluer/bluest](/config/customLogo.gif)
            logo.

## Where can I download Google ChromeOS?

Google ChromeOS is not a conventional operating system that you can download or
buy on a disc and install. As a consumer, the way you will get Google ChromeOS
is by buying a Chromebook that has Google ChromeOS installed by the OEM. Google
ChromeOS is being developed to run on new machines that are specially optimized
for increased security and performance. We are working with manufacturers to
develop reference hardware for Google ChromeOS.

Chromebooks are available for sale now! Check out the [Google Chromebook
site](http://www.google.com/chromebook/) for more information.

## Where can I download ChromiumOS?

If you are the kind of developer who likes to build an open source operating
system from scratch, you can follow the developer instructions to check out
ChromiumOS, build it and experiment with it. A number of sites have also posted
pre-built binaries of ChromiumOS. However, these downloads are not verified by
Google, therefore please ensure you trust the site you are downloading these
from.

Keep in mind that ChromiumOS is not for general consumer use.

## I am a hardware manufacturer, who can I talk to about making a ChromeOS product?

The ChromeOS business development team can be reached at
[chromeos-interested@google.com](mailto:chromeos-interested@google.com).
