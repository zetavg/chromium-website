[TOC]

This document provides a brief overview of how ChromeOS changes get committed
and tested.

For details on **Chrome** changes, see
[Life of a Chrome commit on ChromeOS](chrome_commit_pipeline.md).

## Create a ChromeOS change

### Make and upload changes

See the [developer guide] for how to create a branch and make changes.

Once a change is completed and tested locally, upload it to [chromium-review]:

```repo upload --current-branch .```

### Have your change reviewed

Use [chromium-review] to review your change and prepare it for the commit queue.

See the [gerrit workflow] for details.

## The ChromeOS commit pipeline

As of January 2020, ChromeOS is using the parallel CQ. This documentation has
been updated to reflect how that behaves.

A gross simplification of the ChromeOS Continous Integration (CI):
![Simplified diagram of ChromeOS CQ pipeline](/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/development/cros-commit-pipeline/simplified_cq_pipeline.png)

The CQ collects all changes in the patch series, along with any changes linked
via [Cq-Depend] in the commit messages, and applies them to tip of tree (ToT).
The result is then built and tested by the `cq-orchestrator`.

The `cq-orchestrator` starts jobs to compile and unit test a CL across a variety
of boards (see [chromeos-cq builders]). All of the jobs run in parallel and the
`cq-orchestator` will collect all the results. If there are failures, the
`cq-orchestrator` is a good place to start debugging what went wrong.

Once all the jobs are done, the `cq-orchestrator` kicks off `cros_test_platform`
which starts and monitors all the hardware tests. Tests run by
`cros_test_platform` require hardware resources and they will request this from
the lab infrastructure that is currently in place ([Skylab] as of Jan 2020). If
the hardware resource needed by the test isn't available, the test will wait for
it to become available or timeout after several hours (exact time depends on the
current state of builds and the health of the lab; ask in [go/cros-oncall] if
you need a more accurate number).  Gerrit displays all the jobs started by
`cq-orchestrator` but not the jobs started by `cros_test_platform` so you will
need to click through that chip to monitor the tests.

To get additional help debugging issues with the CQ you can ask for help at
[go/cros-oncall].

### Dry-run

Once a change is marked CQ+1, the CQ will trigger a dry-run. The dry-run will
trigger the `cq-orchestrator` and it will only run the compile + unit test
tasks.  The hardware tests will not be run.

### The Commit-Queue

When a change is marked verified, approved and marked Commit-Queue ready, it
will be sent to the commit queue.

It will follow the procedure described above, compiling the code, running unit
tests and running hardware tests.

### Post-submit builders

[Post-submit builders] are triggered roughly every 7-10 hours. They will run on
the same subset of boards that CQ builders run. ChromeOS sheriffs monitor these
builders to catch any regressions that made it through CQ.

### The Release (Canary) Builders

The ToT (canary) **[release]** builders are triggered automatically according
to a schedule, currently 3 times per day. The release builders will run on all
boards (not just a subset) and so may catch issues that may be missed by the
post-submit builders.

When you view [goldeneye], the builds and test results you see are from the
release builders.

### Simple Chrome

[Simple Chrome] is intended to provide developers with a reasonably stable
ChromeOS environment for Chrome development.

It uses the results of the [Chrome LKGM] builder to identify a recent stable
canary build (generally the most recent).
