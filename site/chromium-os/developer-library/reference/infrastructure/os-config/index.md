Often times browser and OS programs need to change their behavior at runtime
based on how the OS has been configured.
Further, many of pieces of code often ask the same question (e.g. "Is dev mode
enabled?"), and the way to answer the question might not be clear, or it might
be possible to find the answer through different means.
Here we'll document those various configuration sources and which ones you
should (or should not) be using.

Remember that many of these settings are not finalized at build time, and the
same binary might be used in many different configurations.
For example, we do not compile programs for a specific channel (i.e. the same
binary image is used on stable, beta, dev, and canary), nor do we compile for
a specific runtime mode (i.e. programs need to detect dev-mode vs normal-mode).

## /etc/lsb-release

This file provides a number of fields for the browser, daemons, and users.
However, many of these fields are meant purely for users/debugging, and they
should not be parsed out directly.

Here are all the known fields and whether people may rely on their value.
If it is not marked as *Usable*, then you *must not* parse it out for anything
other than informational display to users.
If a field is not documented here, you must assume it's the same as Usable=No,
in which case you *must not* parse it.

If you want to add more fields, they should go in [os-release] instead.

## /etc/os-release

This file provides a number of fields for the browser, daemons, and users.
However, many of these fields are meant purely for users/debugging, and they
should not be parsed out directly.

More details on this file can be found in the [os-release man page].
It's a standard file among Linux distros and we aim to follow the spec.

Here are all the known fields and whether people may rely on their value.
If it is not marked as *Usable*, then you *must not* parse it out for anything
other than informational display to users.
If a field is not documented here, you must assume it's the same as Usable=No,
in which case you *must not* parse it.

| Usable | Field             | Meaning | Example Value |
|:------:|-------------------|---------|---------------|
|  Yes   | `BUG_REPORT_URL`  | Site where to report bugs | `https://crbug.com/new` |

### /etc/os-release.d/

Overrides and fragments can be dropped in here.
These have higher precedence than the `/etc/os-release` file.
The format is simple: the filename is the key and the content is the value.

For example, if there is an `/etc/os-release.d/NAME` file, then it will be used
instead of the `NAME=...` line in the `/etc/os-release` file.

### Examples

If you want to access fields in this file, please do not parse it yourself.

#### Compiled Code

In platform code, ChromiumOS provides a generic `brillo::OsReleaseReader` in
[brillo/osrelease_reader.h] that can process this file.
This handles both `/etc/os-release` and `/etc/os-release.d/` automatically.

```cpp
...
#include <brillo/osrelease_reader.h>
...
  brillo::OsReleaseReader reader;
  reader.Load();

  std::string value;
  if (!reader.GetString(kSomeKey, &value)) {
    // kSomeKey isn't defined.
    return false;
  }

  // Do something with |value| now.
...
```

#### Shell Code

If you're writing shell code, you shouldn't be accessing this file.
[Please rewrite your code in a better language][rewrite-shell].

## crossystem

This [vboot_reference] `crossystem` program is used to query NVRAM and other
low level system/firmware functionality.

While there are many fields, here are the only ones developers should rely upon
in normal use.
There are a few more, but only for specific usage, which we'll cover next.

All other fields not covered here should be avoided.
Low level firmware projects (like [firmware updater] or [vboot_reference]) are
a bit of an exception as they're tightly integrated.

### Specific-Use Fields

These fields may be used, but generally they're used only in highly specific
code and projects.

| Field                   | R/W | Description |
|-------------------------|:---:|-------------|
| debug_build             | RO  | OS image built for debug features. NB: Code should almost always check `cros_debug` instead. This has no relationship to the OS channel. |
| dev_enable_udc          | RO  | Enable USB Device Controller |

| vdat_flags              | RO  | Raw bit flags from VbSharedData |
| wipeout_request         | R/W | Firmware requested factory reset (wipeout) |

### Banned Fields

There are some fields that specifically should not be used.
We'll document their alternatives.

* `arch` (RO): Shell code could use `uname -a` to get the kernel architecture.
  Userland code generally shouldn't be changing behavior based on the arch.
* `hwid` (RO): See the [board/device detection FAQ](#detect-device).

### Examples

Keep in mind that all fields are not guaranteed to always have a valid value.
That means your queries should be constructed to "fail closed".
In the case of `cros_debug`, you want to always check if dev-mode is enabled
by using `if crossystem 'cros_debug?1'; then` and never check if dev-mode is
disabled by using `if ! crossystem 'cros_debug?0'; then`.
If the system were broken or failing and `cros_debug` was not set up properly,
then `cros_debug` might not be `1` or `0`, so the latter code will wrongly
"succeed"!

#### Compiled Code

The [crossystem.h] header provides a few `VbGet` helpers in the `vboot_host`
library.
Be sure to use pkg-config to locate the `vboot_host` library instead of using
`-lvboot_host` directly.

```c
#include <crossystem.h>
...
  int value = VbGetSystemPropertyInt("cros_debug");
  if (value < 0) {
    // Unable to read the value.
    return false;
  }

  if (value == 1) {
    // Dev mode is enabled.
    return true;
  } else {
    // Not dev mode.
    return false;
  }
```

[crossystem.h]: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/vboot_reference/+/HEAD/host/include/crossystem.h

#### Shell Code

The `crossystem` command provides a simple interface for testing values.

```
  crossystem [param1 [param2 [...]]]
    Prints the current value(s) of the parameter(s).
  crossystem [param1=value1] [param2=value2 [...]]]
    Sets the parameter(s) to the specified value(s).
  crossystem [param1?value1] [param2?value2 [...]]]
    Checks if the parameter(s) all contain the specified value(s).
```

So you can write shell code like:

```sh
if crossystem 'cros_debug?1'; then
  # The cros_debug field is equal to 1.
  ...
else
  # The cros_debug field is not equal to 1 (including not set).
  ...
fi
```

## vpd

The [vpd] tool provides access to Vital Product Data.
Its homepage provides all the details on tools and fields.

Briefly, you'll want to use `vpd_get_value <field>` in tools.

## chromeos-config

The [chromeos-config project] (for unibuild configurations) takes care of
storing and accessing device-specific details.
Its homepage provides all the details on tools and fields.

Briefly, you'll want to use the `cros_config` program and `libcros_config`
library in tools.
Be sure to use pkg-config to locate the `cros_config` library instead of using
`-lcros_config` directly.

## sysctl

Many kernel files have system-wide settings that can be changed at runtime via
the `/proc/sys/` interface.
If you want to override a default value, the best place to do this is via the
`/etc/sysctl.d/` directory using the [sysctl.conf(5)] syntax.
This is processed early in the boot using [sysctl(8)]'s `--system` option.
It runs before boot-services, and before writable filesystems are mounted.
Thus it should be safe to use from a security perspective.

If you only want to set a default value, do not write `/proc/sys/` directly.
Only use config files under `/etc/sysctl.d/`.

Some kernel parameters might be set via [kernel commandline](#kernel-cmdline)
options, including verbose names like `sysctl.foo.bar=value` (which would
effectively write `value` to `/proc/sys/foo/bar`), but that should be avoided
unless strictly necessary during early boot (before init/userspace runs).
Every option in the [kernel commandline](#kernel-cmdline) requires [review and
approval by security](#kernel-cmdline-security) in order to pass signing, and
takes a while to be available to released images.
Further, the [size of the kernel commandline is limited](#kernel-cmdline-size),
going as low as only 512 bytes for some architectures.

### Config Files

The general format is documented in the [sysctl.conf(5)] man page.

If the setting exists on all kernel builds all the time, and it should be set
for all devices, then the easiest answer is to update the
[00-sysctl.conf file installed by the chromeos-base/chromeos-base package]
(https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/HEAD/chromeos-base/chromeos-base/files/00-sysctl.conf).
If possible, this is the preferred route.

If the setting is tied to a specific package/USE flag, then the package can
install a small config file into the `/etc/sysctl.d/` directory itself.

## Kernel Commandline

The Linux kernel has a
[commandline](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html)
string where many internal kernel settings can be overridden.
It also allows for passing arguments to init (e.g. upstart), modifying init's
initial environment, and in general can be parsed by any userland program.

This string basically acts as a global variable that anyone can read.
This is not a good thing.

Due to its [limited size](#kernel-cmdline-size), use of this should be reserved
for when there are no other alternatives.  If a setting must be configured
before userland boots (e.g. the `console=` or `root=` options) or if the
firmware needs to modify it (e.g. [depthcharge rewrites `%U` for the active
rootfs](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/depthcharge/+/refs/heads/main/src/boot/commandline.c#77)),
then it makes sense to live here.  Otherwise, please find a different way of
passing the value.

In general, this string is meant only for configuring the kernel, and for the
firmware to communicate some settings to the kernel.  Do not use it for
arbitrary userland settings, and certainly not daemon-specific ones.

Because of the way the kernel automatically parses this setting, care must be
taken when defining a new option that the kernel does not understand.
Otherwise it can be easy to accidentally leak this into userland by setting
it as a new environment variable.

### Security

The kernel commandline is stored in the verified kernel partition so that it is
checked by the firmware before it's allowed to boot.  This is to avoid people
modifying it and adding malicious settings (e.g. setting init to an arbitrary
shell script).  This also means any changes to the commandline will invalidate
the signature and the firmware will not boot it.

Further, every option requires review and approval by security in order to pass
signing.  If you want to add a new option that hasn't been approved previously,
make sure to document how it's used and why it isn't a "security concern" to
let boards override it.

Keep in mind that even once merged, it takes a while (on the order of a week)
before the production signer will see the updated configs.  If you want to add
a new kernel commandline option to a board, it must follow this process before
it can be added, otherwise the release builders will fail when the signer
rejects the new/unknown option.

See the
`~/chromiumos/src/platform/signing/signer-dev/security_test_baselines/ensure_secure_kernelparams.config`
file for more details.

### Examples

If you must parse this, please avoid doing naive things like substring searches.
The format is a string with arbitrary spacing and ordering, and no limit as to
contents.

For example, if you wanted to add a keyword `foo`, and there are already
`foobar` or `kernel.setting="foo"` settings, then simply grepping for `foo` will
incorrectly match.  Adding spaces around it like `\ foo\ ` wouldn't work if the
`foo` keyword was the first or last item.

This is why kernel settings should be properly tokenized and checked.  The
syntax largely boils down to `key=value` pairs with `value` being optionally
quoted with `"` and separated by whitespace.

### Size Limits

The kernel commandline is not infinitely large.  It's not even reasonably big,
and the exact limit depends on a number of factors, most significantly the
architecture of the kernel.  This is partially due to the kernel commandline
being passed from the bootloader as part of the initial ABI.

The limit is [defined in the kernel using the arch-specific `COMMAND_LINE_SIZE`
constant](https://source.chromium.org/search?q=f:kernel%2Fv6.1%20define%5Cs*COMMAND_LINE_SIZE&sq=&ss=chromiumos).

Here are the relevant kernel limits for easy reference.  Remember, this is the
ABI of the kernel itself, not of userland which may be different.

| Architecture                 | Size (bytes) |
|:----------------------------:|:------------:|
| arm (32-bit)                 | 1024 |
| arm64 (aarch64 / arm 64-bit) | 2048 |
| x86 32-bit                   | 2048 |
| x86_64 (x86 64-bit)          | 2048 |
| mips (all bit sizes)         | 4096 |
| riscv (32-bit & 64-bit)      | 1024 |
| asm-generic                  | 512 |

The asm-generic value is the default for new ports that don't define a more
specific value.  Think of it as "future intentions".

#### Bootloader Limits

The sizes above are how big of a buffer that the kernel will accept.  Anything
larger is usually silently truncated.

The other side of the ABI is the caller -- i.e. the bootloader.  Even if the
kernel were to increase its limits, the bootloader would need need update too.

CrOS uses
[depthcharge](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/depthcharge)
to boot the Linux kernel.  It has a
[4096 byte limit](https://source.chromium.org/search?q=f:depthcharge%20CmdLineSize&ss=chromiumos)
which means it can support all current architecture ports.

Other bootloaders (e.g. Das U-Boot and Grub and syslinux) should also support
the minimum kernel sizes quoted above.

## USE Flags

Gentoo USE flags may be used at build time to control high level features.
This is useful for a build that wants to enable/disable large functionality
like touchscreen support, stylus support, or ARC++ availability.

This will usually take the shape of the ebuild listing the flag in IUSE and
then passing that down to the build environment.

These flags can be passed to the runtime as well via [libchromeos-use-flags].
This is explained in more detail in the [login_manager documentation].

USE flags must not be used to set board names (e.g. `kevin` or `link`).
See the [board/device behavior FAQ](#device-behavior) for alternatives.

[libchromeos-use-flags]: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/HEAD/chromeos-base/libchromeos-use-flags/

### cros-board.eclass

No package should be using the [cros-board.eclass] anymore.
This was used in the past to allow packages to vary behavior at build time based
on the board, but we no longer want to let packages do that.

You might still find some packages in the tree using them, but it's because we
haven't yet migrated them off.
https://issuetracker.google.com/194831262 is tracking that work.

[cros-board.eclass]: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/HEAD/eclass/cros-board.eclass

## FAQ

### How do I query dev mode status?

Use `cros_debug?1` from [crossystem].
Never use `cros_debug?0`.

This tells you whether to enable dev-mode-specific features (like shell access).
In general, programs should not change their behavior depending on whether the
system is in dev-mode or normal-mode.
This makes testing much harder as we do not run any tests in normal-mode.

Do not confuse dev-mode with "rootfs verification enabled" or "verified mode".
It is possible to have rootfs verification enabled while in dev-mode.

Do not confuse dev-mode with the keyset used to sign or verify the system.
This has no relationship to devkeys, premp keys, or mp keys.

Do not confuse dev-mode with the dev channel release track.
They have no relationship at all.

### How do I find the current channel?

Use `CHROMEOS_RELEASE_TRACK` from [lsb-release].

This will have values like `stable-channel`, `beta-channel`, `dev-channel`,
`canary-channel`, and `testimage-channel`.
Take note that test images use a `testimage` prefix and not `test`.

It is not possible (by design) to build code for a specific channel.
Our release process takes an OS image and publishes it in the canary channel.
Promoting it to dev/beta/stable only involves modifying the [lsb-release] file.
The code is never recompiled.

However, most code should never change its behavior based on the active channel.
If you have a feature you want to keep testing in e.g. canary channel before
releasing it in a newer version, then you should look into [Finch] instead.
Among other things, it provides a kill switch in case something goes wrong.

### How do I change behavior based on board/device?

If the board is already unibuild-enabled, then you should always use that to
change runtime behavior.
See the [chromeos-config section] for more details.
If the project you're working on does not yet support unibuild, then you will
need to update it to support unibuild.
If the setting you want to vary isn't in the unibuild schema yet, then you will
need to update it to include/document this new setting.
The difficulty of extending existing projects is not an excuse to use deprecated
methods for changing settings (i.e. the next paragraphs).

If you're working on an older board that isn't unibuild-enabled, then you have a
few options:

* If a USE flag is already available, [key off of that](#use-flags).
* Update the board's bsp ebuild to install custom init scripts or config files.
* [Query the board name](#detect-device).

### How do I find the current board/device?

Please see the previous question about changing behavior based on board/device.
If you follow those guidelines, you usually shouldn't need the exact board/device
name in the first place.

Use `cros_config / name` to get the device name.

Put simply, a single board (e.g. coral) can be used across multiple devices
(e.g. astronaut, nasher, robo, etc...).
The device name is used to disambiguate at runtime in a single board image.

Do not use `crossystem hwid` or `CHROMEOS_RELEASE_BOARD` in `/etc/lsb-release`.
These do not handle unibuild where a single board supports multiple devices.

### How do I pass different flags to Chrome (the browser)?

See the [login_manager documentation] for more details.

### How do I find out the keyset used to sign the image (PreMP/MP/etc...)?

In short, you don't.
Code must not change its behavior based on whether the running image has been
signed with "premp" or "mp" keys.
Trying to do this significantly & negatively impacts both automated testing and
early dogfood testing with users.

Use some other knob to control behavior (such as [Finch]).
