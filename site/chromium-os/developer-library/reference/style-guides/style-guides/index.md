title: ChromiumOS style guide [go/cros-style]
---

As a general rule, we try to follow existing style guides of parent projects
when they have one.

* First [Chromium],
* Then [Google],
* Otherwise try to find a community/language standard.

That is why the list of style guides below is not "complete" -- if we don't have
anything CrOS-specific to add, then we won't make our own.

## Style Guides

*   [CrOS Python Style Guide](/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/style-guides/python/)
*   [CrOS Shell Style Guide](/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/style-guides/shell/)
*   [Gentoo Ebuild Style Guide](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/file-format/index.html#indenting-and-whitespace)
