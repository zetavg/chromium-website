[TOC]

## Introduction

You must follow this guide for all Python source code that is created as part
of the ChromiumOS project i.e. src/platform/\*. In doing so, you make it easier
for others to work with your code.

This guide may be ignored if you are working on code that is part of an open
source project that already conforms to a different style i.e. generally Python
code in src/third\_party.  Autotest is a great example of this - see the [other
notable Python style guides](#Other-notable-Python-style-guides) below.

See also the overall [Chromium coding style].

## Official Style Guide

The [Google Python Style guide] is the official Python style guide for
ChromiumOS original code.

New projects should use that unmodified public Python Google style guide
(4 space indent with methods\_with\_underscores). Historically, we adopted a
style that was congruent with Google internal Python style guide (2 spaces with
MethodsAsCamelCase). Individual older projects are in the process of migrating
to the public style as time allows; there is no mandate to migrate.

That is, for new projects, use:

*   [Indentation]: 4 spaces
*   [Naming]: Functions and Method names use lower\_with\_under()

If that guide is silent on an issue, then you should fall back to [PEP-8].

[PEP-257] is referenced by PEP-8.  If it isn't covered in the
[Comments section], you can also fall back to PEP-257.

## Other notable Python style guides

There are a number of other Python style guidelines out there.

*   [The CODING STYLE file for autotest] - When working on autotest code (or
    any autotest tests), you should ignore the ChromiumOS style guidelines
    (AKA this page) and use the autotest ones.

## Auto-formatting Python

An easy way to get people to agree on formatting, and to reduce the
effort required around manual formatting, is to use an auto-formatter.
The preferred auto-formatter for Python in ChromiumOS is [Black].

To format your code with Black in your project, run:

```shell
cros format .
```

Or for files that `cros format` doesn't detect as python:
```shell
black --config ~/chromiumos/chromite/pyproject.toml file_without_py_suffix
```

Then, to enforce Black in pre-upload, add to `PRESUBMIT.cfg`:

```ini
[Hook Overrides]
black_check: true
```

For compatibility with `pylint`, you'll want to disable the
`bad-continuation`, `bad-indentation`, `invalid-string-quote`,
`invalid-docstring-quote`, and `invalid-triple-quote` options.  Don't
worry: you'll still be checking these for formatting consistency with
Black.

## Describing arguments in docstrings

[PEP-257] says that "The docstring for a function or method should summarize
its behavior and document its arguments, return value(s), side effects,
exceptions raised, and restrictions. However, it doesn't specify any details of
what this should look like.

Fortunately, the Google Python style guide provides a [reasonable syntax for
arguments and return values].  We will use that as our standard.

The content of each subsection (e.g. `Args`, `Returns`, etc...) should use the
same indentation level as the file.  If the file is using 2 spaces, then the
subsection content should use 2 space indents (as seen in the example below).
If the file is using 4 space indents, then the subsection content should use
4 space indents as well.  In both situations, use 4 space hanging indentation
for long argument descriptions (as seen with `keys:` below).

All docstring content should use full sentences (proper capitalization &
periods), including argument descriptions (as seen below).  This applies even
when the docstring is a one-liner.

```python
def fetch_bigtable_rows(big_table, keys, other_silly_variable=None):
    """Fetches rows from a Bigtable.

    Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance
    represented by big_table.  Silly things may happen if
    other_silly_variable is not None.

    Args:
        big_table: An open Bigtable Table instance.
        keys: A sequence of strings representing the key of each table row
            to fetch.
        other_silly_variable: Another optional variable, that has a much
            longer name than the other args, and which does nothing.

    Returns:
        A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
        fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
        example:

        {
            "Serak": ("Rigel VII", "Preparer"),
            "Zim": ("Irk", "Invader"),
            "Lrrr": ("Omicron Persei 8", "Emperor"),
        }

        If a key from the keys argument is missing from the dictionary,
        then that row was not found in the table.

    Raises:
        IOError: An error occurred accessing the bigtable.Table object.
    """
    pass
```

Specifically:

*   **Required**  of all **public methods** to follow this convention.
*   **Encouraged** for all **private methods** to follow this convention. May
    use a one-line sentence describing the function and return value if it's
    simple.
*   All arguments should be described in the `Args:` section, using the format
    above.
    *   Ordering of descriptions should match order of parameters in function.
    *   For two-line descriptions, indent the 2nd line 4 spaces.
    *   If the function doesn't take any arguments, then the `Args:` section may
        be omitted entirely.
*   For functions, if present, `Examples:`, `Args:`, `Returns:` (or `Yields:`
    with generators), and `Raises:` should be in that order and come last in the
    docstring, each separated by a blank line.
*   For classes, only `Examples:` and `Attributes:` are permitted.  When the
    the `__init__` method arguments line up with the class's attributes (e.g.,
    the function does a lot of `self.foo = foo`), there is no need to duplicate
    argument documentation in the `__init__` docstring.  Putting information in
    the class's attributes is preferred.

## Imports

The following rules apply to imports (in addition to rules already talked about
in [PEP-8] and the [Google Python Style guide]):

*   Relative imports are forbidden ([PEP-8] only "highly discourages" them).
    Where absolutely needed, the `from __future__ import absolute_import`
    syntax should be used (see [PEP-328]).
*   Do not use `import *`. Always be explicit about what you are importing.
    Using `import *` is useful for interactive Python but shouldn't be used in
    checked-in code.
*   While `import` statements are only for packages and modules, we also except
    the `Path` object from `pathlib` in addition to the other exceptions already
    mentioned in the [Google Python Style guide].

Examples:

``` python
# OK, this imports a module.
from chromite.lib import cros_build_lib

# OK, there's an exception for pathlib.Path.
from pathlib import Path

# Bad, there's no exception for subprocess.run.
from subprocess import run
```

## The shebang line

All files that are meant to be executed should start with the line:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

If your system doesn't support that, it is sufficiently unusual for us to not
worry about compatibility with it.  Most likely it will break in other fun ways.

Files that are not meant to be executed should not contain a shebang line.

## String formatting

It is acceptable to mix f-strings & non-f-string formatting in a codebase,
module, function, or any other grouping.
Do not worry about having to pick only one style.

### f-strings

When writing Python 3.6+ code, prefer [f-strings].
They aren't always the best fit which is why we say you should *prefer* rather
than *always* use them.
See the next section for non-f-string formatting.

Writing readable f-strings is important, so try to avoid packing too much logic
in the middle of the `{...}` sections.
If you need a list comprehension or complicated computation, then it's usually
better to pull it out into a temporary variable instead.
Dynamic code in the middle of static strings can be easy to miss for readers.

### % formatting

The [Google style guide] says that f-strings, [% formatting], and
`"{}".format()` styles are all permitted.
In CrOS, we prefer f-strings foremost, and then [% formatting] over
`"{}".format()`, so you should too to match.
There is no real material difference between the latter two styles, so sticking
with % for consistency is better.

```python
x = "name: %s; score: %d" % (name, n)
x = "name: %(name)s; score: %(score)d" % {"name": name, "score": n}
```

### Logging formatting

Keep in mind that for logging type functions, we don't format in-place.
Instead, we pass them as args to the function.

```python
logging.info("name: %s; score: %d", name, n)
```

## Variables in Comprehensions & Generator Expressions

When using comprehensions & generators, it's best if you stick to "throw away"
variable names.  "x" tends to be the most common iterator.

```python
some_var = [x for x in some_list if x]
```

While helping with readability (since these expressions are supposed to be kept
"simple"), it also helps avoid the problem of variable scopes not being as tight
as people expect.

```python
# This throws an exception because the variable is undefined.
print(x)

some_var = [x for x in (1, 2)]
# This displays "1" because |x| is now defined.
print(x)

string = "some string"
some_var = [string for string in ("a", "b", "c")]
# This displays "c" because the earlier |string| value has been clobbered.
print(string)
```

## TODOs

It is OK to leave TODOs in code.  **Why?**  Encouraging people to at least
document parts of code that need to be thought out more (or that are confusing)
is better than leaving this code undocumented.

See also the [Google style guide] here.

New TODOs should be formatted as follows:

```python
# TODO: b/123456789 - Revisit this code when the frob feature is done.
# TODO: crbug.com/1234567 - Revisit this code when the frob feature is done.
```

The following formats were formerly recommended, but discouraged for use in new
code:

```python
# TODO(username): Revisit this code when the frob feature is done.
# TODO(b/123456789): Revisit this code when the frob feature is done.
# TODO(crbug/1234567): Revisit this code when the frob feature is done.
```

...where `username` is your chromium.org username. If you don't have a
chromium.org username, please use an email address.

Please **do not** use other forms of TODO (like `TBD`, `FIXME`, `XXX`, etc).
This makes TODOs much harder for someone to find in the code.

## pylint

Python code written for ChromiumOS should be "pylint clean".

[Pylint] is a utility that analyzes Python code to look for bugs and for style
violations.  We run it in ChromiumOS because:

*   It can catch bugs at "compile time" that otherwise wouldn't show up until
    runtime.  This can include typos and also places where you forgot to import
    the required module.
*   It helps to ensure that everyone is following the style guidelines.

Pylint is notoriously picky and sometimes warns about things that are really OK.
Because of this, we:

*   Disable certain warnings in the ChromiumOS pylintrc.
*   Don't consider it a problem to locally disable warnings parts of code.
    **NOTE**: There should be a high bar for disabling warnings.
    Specifically, you should first think about whether there's a way to rewrite
    the code to avoid the warning before disabling it.

You can use `cros lint` so that we can be sure everyone is on the same version.
This should work outside and inside the chroot.

## Python 2 Compatibility

There is no need to keep code compatible with Python 2.  That means all new
files should omit the boiler plate lines:

* `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`
* `from __future__ import absolute_import`
* `from __future__ import print_function`

## Other Considerations

### Unit tests

All Python modules should have a corresponding unit test module called
`<original name>_unittest.py` in the same directory.  We use a few related
modules (they're available in the chroot as well):

*   [mock] (`import mock`) for testing mocks
    *   It has become the official Python mock library starting in 3.3
    *   [pymox] (`import mox`) is the old mock framework

*   You'll still see code using this as not all have been migrated to mock yet

*   [unittest] (`import unittest`) for unit test suites and methods for testing

### Main Modules

*   All main modules require a `main` method.  Use this boilerplate at the end:
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        sys.exit(main(sys.argv[1:]))
    ```
    *   The definition of `main` itself should look like:
        ```python
        def main(argv: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> Optional[int]:
            ...
            # A standard argparse.ArgumentParser parser.
            opts = parser.parse_args(argv)
        ```
        This allows re-use of Python's `console_scripts` wrappers.
    *   Having `main` accept the arguments instead of going through the implicit
        global `sys.argv` state allows for better reuse & unittesting: other
        modules are able to import your module and then invoke it with
        `main(["foo", "bar"])`.
    *   The `sys.exit` allows `main` to return values which makes it easy to
        unittest, and easier to reason about behavior in general: you can always
        use `return` and not worry if you're in a func that expects a `sys.exit`
        call.  If your func doesn't explicitly return, then you still get the
        default behavior of `sys.exit(0)`.
    *   If you want a stable string for prefixing output, you shouldn't rely on
        `sys.argv[0]` at all as the caller can set that to whatever it wants (it
        is never guaranteed to be the basename of your script).  You should set
        a constant in your module, or you should base it off the filename.
        ```python
        # A constant string that is guaranteed to never change.
        _NAME = "foo"
        # The filename which should be stable (respects symlink names).
        _NAME = os.path.basename(__file__)
        # The filename which derefs symlinks.
        _NAME = os.path.basename(os.path.realpath(__file__))
        ```
    *   If your main func wants `argv[0]`, you should use `sys.argv[0]`
        directly. If you're trying to print an error message, then usually you
        want to use `argparse` (see below) and the `parser.error()` helper
        instead.

*   Main modules should have a symlink without an extension that point to the
    .py file.  All actual code should be in .py files.

### Other

*   There should be one blank line between conditional blocks.
*   Do not use `GFlags`, `getopt`, or `optparse` anymore -- stick to `argparse`
    everywhere.
