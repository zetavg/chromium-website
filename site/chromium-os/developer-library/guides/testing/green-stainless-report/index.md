## Exclude flaky or pre-release from report

**Problem**

Want to exclude a test from being reported in Stainless weekly email temporarily
while working on the cause of the flake or until the feature is ready to be
enabled by default.

**Solution**

Temporarially you can update the "In Development" sheet in
go/cros-green-stainless-all to `In Development` for the test(s) that should
not be listed in the report. Once tests are ready remove from sheet.

See "Status Types" document for background.

## Update bug in report

**Problem**

Bug related to failing/flakey test in weekly report or on dashboard is wrong or
missing.

**Solution**

Add an entry to the "BUG" sheet in go/cros-green-stainless-all
with the name of your test and the ID for the bug. If multiple bugs you can
comma separate them.

# TODO: Add a blurb on how to get a missing test loaded into the spreadsheet.
