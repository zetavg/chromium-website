title: Fuzz testing in ChromeOS (dupe)
---

[Fuzzing] is a testing technique that feeds auto-generated inputs to a piece
of target code in an attempt to crash the code. It's one of the most effective
methods we have for finding [security] and [non-security bugs]
(also see [go/fuzzing-success]). This guide introduces ChromeOS developers to fuzz
testing.

You can learn more about the benefits of fuzzing at [go/why-fuzz].

[TOC]

## Getting Started

For more information about ChromeOS kernel fuzzing, see
[here](/chromium-os/developer-library/guides/testing/kernel-fuzzing/).
Userspace fuzzing on ChromeOS will be discussed below.

In ChromeOS, you can easily create and submit fuzz targets. The targets are
automatically built by buildbots, and then uploaded to the distributed
[ClusterFuzz] fuzzing system to run at scale.

Create your first fuzz target and submit it by stepping through our [Quickstart
Guide].

## Getting help

You can [chat](http://go/fuzzing-chat) or send an email to [chromeos-fuzzing@google.com] if you get
stuck, or to ask questions.
