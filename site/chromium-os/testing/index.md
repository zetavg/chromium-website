## This is the home page for testing. You should find everything related to writing tests, modifying existing tests, and running tests here. Please feel free to send an email to [chromium-os-dev@chromium.org ](mailto:chromium-os-dev@chromium.org)if you have any questions.

## Autotest

This has additional info on how to [run the smoke test suite on a Virtual
Machine](/chromium-os/testing/running-smoke-suite-on-a-vm-image).

Before you check in a change, you should also do [a trybot run
locally](/chromium-os/build/local-trybot-documentation), which will run unit
tests and smoke tests in the same way that the builders do.
