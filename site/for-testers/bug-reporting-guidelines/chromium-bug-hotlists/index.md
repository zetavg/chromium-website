## Hotlists

Labels are now replaced with hotlists in the issue tracker.  A hotlist in Google Issue Tracker
is a list of specific issues, where you manually add or remove the issues. A new issue only
appears in a hotlist if you or another user explicitly adds it and it remains in the hotlist
regardless of any changes that are made to it. Hotlists allow you to track a set of issues
related to a common goal, such as a product launch or particular feature.

## Bookmark Groups

A bookmark group in Google Issue Tracker is a collection of hotlists and saved searches.
Bookmark groups allow you to easily collect and track sets of issues.
